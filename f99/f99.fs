// P18 (**) Extract a slice from a list.
//Given two indices, I and K, the slice is the list containing the elements between the I'th and K'th element of

//?­ rotate([a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h],­2,X).
//X = [g,h,a,b,c,d,e,f]
//Hint: Use the predefined predicates length/2 and append/3, as well as the result of problem P17



//P23 (**) Extract a given number of randomly selected elements from a list.
//The selected items shall be put into a result list.
//Example:
//?­ rnd_select([a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h],3,L).
//L = [e,d,a]
//Hint: Use the built­in random number generator random/2 and the result of problem P20.

//P24 (*) Lotto: Draw N different random numbers from the set 1..M.
//The selected numbers shall be put into a result list.
//Example:
//?­ rnd_select(6,49,L).
//L = [23,1,17,33,21,37]
//Hint: Combine the solutions of problems P22 and P23.

//P25 (*) Generate a random permutation of the elements of a list.Example:
//?­ rnd_permu([a,b,c,d,e,f],L).
//L = [b,a,d,c,e,f]
//Hint: Use the solution of problem P23.

// P26 (**) Generate the combinations of K distinct objects chosen from the N elements of a list
// In how many ways can a committee of 3 be chosen from a group of 12 people? We all know that there
// are C(12,3) = 220 possibilities (C(N,K) denotes the well­known binomial coefficients). For pure
// mathematicians, this result may be great. But we want to really generate all the possibilities (via
// backtracking).
// Example:
// ?­ combination(3,[a,b,c,d,e,f],L).
// L = [a,b,c] ;
// L = [a,b,d] ;
// L = [a,b,e] ;
// ...

// P27 (**) Group the elements of a set into disjoint subsets.
// a) In how many ways can a group of 9 people work in 3 disjoint subgroups of 2, 3 and 4 persons? Write
// a predicate that generates all the possibilities via backtracking.
// Example:
// ?­ group3([aldo,beat,carla,david,evi,flip,gary,hugo,ida],G1,G2,G3).
// G1 = [aldo,beat], G2 = [carla,david,evi], G3 = [flip,gary,hugo,ida]
// ...
// b) Generalize the above predicate in a way that we can specify a list of group sizes and the predicate will
// return a list of groups.
// Example:
// ?­ group([aldo,beat,carla,david,evi,flip,gary,hugo,ida],[2,2,5],Gs).
// Gs = [[aldo,beat],[carla,david],[evi,flip,gary,hugo,ida]]
// ...
// Note that we do not want permutations of the group members; i.e. [[aldo,beat],...] is the same solution as
// [[beat,aldo],...]. However, we make a difference between [[aldo,beat],[carla,david],...] and
// [[carla,david],[aldo,beat],...].
// You may find more about this combinatorial problem in a good book on discrete mathematics under the
// term "multinomial coefficients".

// P28 (**) Sorting a list of lists according to length of sublists
// a) We suppose that a list (InList) contains elements that are lists themselves. The objective is to sort theelements of InList according to their length. E.g. short lists first, longer lists later, or vice versa.
// Example:
// ?­ lsort([[a,b,c],[d,e],[f,g,h],[d,e],[i,j,k,l],[m,n],[o]],L).
// L = [[o], [d, e], [d, e], [m, n], [a, b, c], [f, g, h], [i, j, k, l]]
// b) Again, we suppose that a list (InList) contains elements that are lists themselves. But this time the
// objective is to sort the elements of InList according to their length frequency; i.e. in the default, where
// sorting is done ascendingly, lists with rare lengths are placed first, others with a more frequent length come
// later.
// Example:
//­ lfsort([[a,b,c],[d,e],[f,g,h],[d,e],[i,j,k,l],[m,n],[o]],L).
// L = [[i, j, k, l], [o], [a, b, c], [f, g, h], [d, e], [d, e], [m, n]]
// Note that in the above example, the first two lists in the result L have length 4 and 1, both lengths appear
// just once. The third and forth list have length 3 which appears, there are two list of this length. And finally,
// the last three lists have length 2. This is the most frequent length.
